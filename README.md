# Forkify

### Find recipes, save your favorites !


This app is built with pure vanilla JavaScript along with HTML and SCSS. It uses webpack as module bundler,

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript)
- [Webpack](https://parceljs.org/)

## Usage


- The Forkify Recipe App allows users to search for recipes.


- Users can view the recipe along with the cook time and also
   increase or decrease the amount of servings they need.

- Bookmarked recipes are stored in local storage so no database was
   required for this application.
